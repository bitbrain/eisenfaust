This README file is to accompany the following file:

        RUNES14.zip    Rune font pack for Windows w/help & MS-Word utils



What is this:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"AngloSaxon Runes", "Germanic Runes" and "Dwarf Runes" are MS-Windows 3.1 
compatible Truetype (and ATM) fonts.  They can be used to write Runic 
inscriptions with MS-Windows applications.  There are three MS-WORD 6.0 
macros that greatly simplify using the Fonts.  Also included is a Windows Help 
file detailing the history, usage and keyboard mapping of all characters in the 
font. 

These fonts can not be sold for a profit.  (Although, if you really enjoy using 
these fonts and need to find some financial way of showing your appreciation. 
Any and all donations will be gladly accepted.)  CD-ROM and Shareware 
distributors are requested to notify me before distributing these fonts.

These fonts may be used in any publication.  Please contact me if these fonts 
do appear in a publication. I'd like to receive a copy of it, and I may be able 
to provide further assistance by creating custom fonts or clip art for you.

These fonts are Postcard-ware.  If you like these fonts, please send me a 
postcard or letter (using an attractive or interesting stamp). If you supply me 
with your email address, I'll try to write back. You can get my current postal 
address by visiting my WWW home page, listed below.  If you do write, please 
tell me of your Runic writing interests.  And feel free to offer any 
constructive suggestions for improving the fonts and the accompanying 
documentation.  

This document is my best attempt at explaining basic Rune usage.  It does not 
describe all of the complexities of Rune usage, nor will it explain any details 
of the Old Germanic or Anglo-Saxon languages.  This document is not official or 
authorized by anyone.  If you discover any errors, inaccuracies, or problems 
with these fonts, or this document, I encourage you to contact me.  My current 
postal address is listed on my WWW home page, or you can email me.

How to install a MS-Windows-3.1 Truetype font:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you don't know how to install new Truetype fonts, follow the directions 
below (Since you are reading this file, I will assume that you have already 
"PKUNZIP'ed" the ZIP file onto a temp directory on your hard disk.):
  - Start MS-Windows-3.1.
  - Go to the MAIN folder and select CONTROL PANEL.
  - Select FONTS.
  - Select ADD.
  - In this dialog box, go to the section marked 'Drives' and use the
    scroll buttons to click on the drive (C:, D:, or whatever) you 
    have the unzipped files to.
  - Use the section marked 'Directories' to the left of 'Drives' to
    select the directory the unzipped files are in.
  - The font names will appear in the section marked 'List of Fonts'.
  - Click on the font you want to install (using the mouse).
  - Click on 'OK'.
This should install the font so that your Windows applications can use it. 
Don't forget to check the RUNES.HLP file included in the ZIP file. It will 
explain the key-mapping and show an example of font usage. 

These fonts should be compatable with Windows95 and OS/2.  But since I don't 
have either of these PC operating systems, I can't explain how to properly 
install them.



How to install a MS-Word 6.0 macros, toolbars and help file:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To install the macros and toolbars:
  - Please read the notice about Microsoft Word 6.0 - WordBasic Macro viruses 
    that I've included at the bottom of this file.
  - Start MS-Windows-3.1.
  - Start Microsoft Word 6.0.
  - From Microsoft Word 6.0 "File" drop-down menu, open the 
    "RUNES.DOT" file. 
    (A dialog box will appear and ask you for permission to continue 
    with the installation.)
  - Click on the "Yes" pushbutton (using the mouse).
The toolbar and macros will now become part of your normal Word set-up.



How to un-install the MS-Word 6.0 macros, toolbars and help file:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To un-install the macros and toolbars:
  - Start MS-Windows-3.1.
  - Start Microsoft Word 6.0.
  - From Microsoft Word 6.0 "File" drop-down menu, open the 
    "RUNES.DOT" file. 
    (A dialog box will appear and ask you for permission to un-install or  
    re-install the macros bars.)
  - Using the mouse, click on the "Un-install" pushbutton.
The toolbar and macros will no longer be part of your normal Word set-up.

The "RUNES.DOT" file contains an "AutoOpen" WordBasic macro which starts running 
as soon as the file is opened by Microsoft Word.  Microsoft has found that some 
Hackers have been able to insert destructive commands into "AutoOpen" WordBasic 
macros.  Microsoft has responded by making freely available to all Word users a 
WordBasic Virus detection kit. (This can be downloaded from "www.microsoft.com" 
or via "MSN".)  Microsoft's WordBasic anti-virus works by informing you every 
time you open a Word document or template file that contains an "AutoOpen" 
macro.  If you have installed Microsoft's WordBasic anti-virus detector and you 
attempt to open my "RUNES.DOT" file, the WordBasic anti-virus detector will 
identify my "AutoOpen" macro and offer you the choice to stop it before it 
starts running.

My Rune WordBasic macros have been tested and have run without problems on 
several different PCs running Microsoft Word 6.0 in Microsoft Windows 3.1 and 
3.11.  I have been informed that they also work well with Microsoft Word 7.0 and 
with Microsoft Windows 95.  None of the WordBasic macros contains commands or 
instructions that could in any way harm or damage your PC.  But just to be safe 
and legal I need to state that: 

   =======================================================================
   By installing these Rune Fonts and associated WordBasic macros on   
   their PCs, the user assumes all responsibility for their use or misuse.  
   Daniel S. Smith can not be held responsible for any damages caused by 
   using these Fonts or WordBasic macros.
